Reclining syncretically between Isère and Drac. A new bivouac snuggling crumbling col, between this and that. A cloudblanket uncertain, ephemeral, flying past rare old days. It is your hundredth day of recollectable life, where are the others? Last Thursdayism. A single day translated, scrappily, impossibly spelling it out, the fate of memory to misplace the subtleties. The tiles are hot, I'm walking across hot tiles in Lisbon Garo do Oriente, fastening myself into memory. Remain in state. Remembering Portugal's maritime history. Landed and untackled, forget the language as time goes on. Impression of our ink on skin, what hath the monks tattooed in common.

Carefully reading the subscripts. Across recto and verso they reflect. The dishing out of unnecessary skill. Three languages I can't speak in two weeks. Pressing myself to remember. The undissolvable irreducible brilliance we have to witness, the obstacle of thought in the way. Craning my head. Am I lying to myself? Trying to put everything in a box. Fighting my lacquering dreams shut. With every glow of a dribbling candle at night in horological attack. Here in Dauphiné watching the cloud move in two senses. Flew, flying, drifting over people again and here we are still looking masticated. In different languages yet the same lexeme, life is a dream.

A tale suspended and poetic licence revoked. An old photo of myself. In the old days I was younger and in clay-heavy rivers my image foggily complicates. Great consolation as I cloud over. Consonantly passing by, one current underpinning two rivers in three valleys. Sluicing the earth. Eddies around cutwaters, complication from groundedness. Contraflows spinning on the glassy top. Around two piers the furrowed backflow yawns. Giants on the great plinth of Dent de Crolles looking down at the purling, spinning mess. A shocking glint of light levelled on the lowlying meadows and their clear rivers. An claidheamh soluis.

Expeditiously composing ourselves, we move. In the silent way I sometimes prove my passing through. What belongings we take from the earth: shivering fingertip treasure in microscopic pockets. Clocks and reusable mockeries. An Irishman in a knot of spirit, passing the time and not the limit.
