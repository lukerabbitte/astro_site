Pragmatically shelving the tinny objections, she sees her hair into stasis. There is something in the way she moves, like a low ape with a cool gait moaning at the sun, tripping over the features of the forest floor. She woke up still dreaming, dreaming of a static harbour where something clever comes over her and, forgetting to breathe, she leaps her breeches off and her hair is a tangled pulsar, still the limping-away image of a minor fishing boat from over there, smelling the bands of wooden engineering like a reminder of a cosy hunting home, the fish whimper to the ducks and every animal that we tickle to death, dumped in that rotten memorial that calls the food to its fork. Using too many pairs of plates in the good room. So used, so used, licking like a drooping fool at the moon. Tickling her hair, fingering the corona-gold medal of daylight, lingering on the cold beauty of her armoire she expects what happens next.

Hermits colour their soil with runoff
She saw a picture of an angel
That lived in a fake dwelling that never existed
In a hill of chancers
She decided to ask the single question that would animate rather confusing nightmares cloudy as a tap that is pulling from the earth
A hard style of water
A hard kind of question answering is to uproot
Entirely everything
Such as the mind kind of does when it loves someone or follows them in high-risk mayhem.
Purgatorily, she went one step at a time. Lived where the smelling rottweilers guard the gates, always being one step beneath, retiring unconsciously from the molten centre of the senate. In the censure of the senate, the unconscious paradise. Imagine being the witness to even a single specimen of domestic or animal abuse. It would do a killing to your soul. Really pull and pick the folding lumps of your brain. Let spray a firing network. Polluting the air the grain breathes on, trampling down naturalised hedgerow species, bloodletting human mistakes until they leak far too deep in the soul. A depth far beyond belief creeping. The nest with far too many eggs.

Her hair is a floating holy ghost, risen up the flagpole of hope. Proud the noble host, the soldier, in fact, who lifts her groaning vote to the post. Pins her sails, caulks her boats, wears herself correctly in life and in cloth. Drags herself out of the mess of the dust of the arid edgecases. Helps herself onto the slide of science in the name calling game of a caped cage of puppies you cannot even see, guessing which whelped what, training yourself to believe in uncomfortable recipes. Nevertheless, instantly to be getting onwards, she slides a piece of cake down her throat and shrugs off the cruel mistake of sleep. It is considered a mistake to dream an unsacred dream in this place. She never received a mortgage on her faith. Her intention was to paint herself into an accustomed, pre-established, waxing and waning, large-spanning, fullscreen yellowing frame and be the sun that yellows it. She wanted to bury herself in the famous pain of it all and be the sun that burns history away, one page of paper and one pale frame of canvas, one previously brilliant cable threading fraying and greying, one underlying skeleton X ray borne to the earth again, the one and only colourful stain they could ever imagine or deign to retain at a time.

She was in Paris in the Alexander the Great section on a French holiday when she came up with her name. They say it's common to follow saintlike the inventions of history. Prick their fingers. Nothing is revolved around the headspace like the cultural genetics of religion. It incensed her from the age where she was barely able to speak until she couldn't walk. A blink between two dreams that stay in bed. A credible story. Creativity as a function of restriction. Special education was required to hold cool hands to the river bed, to the concrete like-sediment cutting the earth away. All the best treasures are cut away and a lot of them are swept. Allaying the fears of a type of earthquake that could break the flow, turn the whole table of the earth sideways, it was more predictable to deftly cut the riversides like soft wax. This was the fact of sisterhood and it still is, it is the spiderweb of creation and hurricane of destruction that keeps her coming back, holds her flat on her growing rack.

Looking out her Wicklow Mountain windows she examined life's ancient systems. Human infrastructure creaks after paltry decades, meek and thirstily longing for inventory, nothing like the wide everything of reality. Human brains rest on a head-high shelf,Â  shrink everything. The best prayer is the best reduction.

A kid running towards a hill. The real revolution comes in a stroke of sneaking genius. It could only take a couple of minutes. The prettiest noun in any language, the most pardening flower in the garden. Me and you reclining in the fragrance. Nous. The sort of languid hanging fruit that becomes famous.

She timed the lightning cracks to listen to it laughing back. She analysed the distance between herself and the line of evergreens, in her prey-like side-eye she saw them split, the trees that just got hit by it. Waving trunks that point to heaven punished. Coursing like the voltaic blue, at the apogee of life and yet back to grueling soot. There is no apology you could muster up to summon what remains. A dementia cursed bat that forgets how to flap back home. He paints the sky with bell-like music. Never will fall asleep in the same place again. Angelically sinched-up wings in the hallowed evening. Let this home lay uncharacteristically fallow, lightening sky and gathering shadow.
