Spinning foreignly around  
Beauty like the moon out of reach  
Cascading telescope  
Cupping our eye  
Up along the drywall  
Divided suckling sky  
Chuckling higher power supply  
Shy grit-spat silver lump  
From real ether  
Goes flat  
  
And not the in coming out  
Thumping and balance swung  
About seachanges of doubt  
Death knell  
Nor the round white trout stare  
Gloating ghostlike  
Floater  
Away with the laserlike scared fare in focus  
Never-been-there-before  
Territory  
Hand-sketched from memory  
Could tell a better story  
  
It is the finding  
Organising stories in the first place that  
Begets the beautiful dream of life  
The inevitability  
The lossless cry that we forget  
Sweeps paradisically by  
Every cold globe of the shape of the earth  
Every glass eye  
Glints awry  
Heaven  
When we remember why  
  
From lumpy prophets' closets  
Our hoarse mutters clothed in earshot course  
Forcefully  
As a river in estuary  
Scuttled on the first wave of tomorrow  
Plosion  
It suddenly shies  
Fluttering bloodlike supply  
Throwing drifts of fluent  
Lift and tug  
Spill and duck  
On the saltgrave miring  
Shrug and level  
This tireless cold water wrestle  
Pulsing  
Dug and nestled  
Blood vessel expulsion  
In plain sight  
  
And our ears  
Our two ears tuned to  
Glean goodbyes  
Negativity improvised  
Simple antennas  
Grown-up-edly mocking the loudness of doubt  
Wronging the devout silence  
Drowned out  
Recollecting the opportune  
Grand soundtrack we teach to ourselves  
Inside out  
To keep clockwork beat to  
Throughout  
Plainsong to sing along to  
Lifelong  
  
Soon the clean blood circulatory  
Arrives to its true fears  
In arrears  
And knows  
Wise from the throbbing heart of years and years  
It goes and goes  
  
It has the courage to speak  
For the living  
And lend ear to the dead  
To flood earth beyond a given field  
Wash aground with the epics  
Where pure learning is  
Longing  
Purling  
Sure to sink and nourish  
The search  
For the time being  
  
Socket to target  
The once flat moonview from  
The atoll  
Line of sight  
Now runs along a curtainfall  
Aqueduct of needing  
Centre of the seismic sea  
Breathing  
Herder of the writhing world  
As it turns  
Gleefully spilling sideways  
Just in time  
The cosmic spinner of a ring of joy around  
My littlefinger  
Arrives
