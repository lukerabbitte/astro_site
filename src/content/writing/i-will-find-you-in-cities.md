I will find you in some city  
A broken social scene playing itself out  
Enjoying the choruses of life  
You will be spending some time in the Palaeolithic light of Europe  
In the nucleus of it all  
Wondering where have gone the walls  
We scaled to bail our pale faces out from a failing maelstrom  
Angry to be failing to contain  
The dregs  
And you will be looking for puddles  
Drinking to every last drop  
In stop motion  
Hearing wings flap over a distant ocean  
  
I will find you  
Fattened on soft cheese and hard bread in a European city  
Throwing stones at pale washed fa√ßades  
Well smoothed out from the years  
A bag of marbles jingled loose  
On Roman Roads  
Alea jacta est  
You have tuned into local radio  
Fashioning sense from a collection  
Of basically grunts  
You have turned your heel  
On gut feeling  
Putting one thing before another  
You have ran to the beach  
Ran upstairs to balconies  
In good faith  
In the sticky heat  
Randomly landing on the beat  
You are wasting my time at night  
I sit here in the bad light drawing portraits  
From memory  
Where the electricity is dearest  
I should have never left you out of my sight  
  
Where you have gone there is farmland, farmland everywhere  
But not a bite to eat  
I will not be able to save you  
From meteorologically imposed defeat  
I will find you measuring staves  
And melting copper  
Cooping yourself up for the winter  
In a dimly lit kitchen as a loose chicken walks in  
A candle faintly interested in your prayer  
Routine, the hope for surplus  
You, the player in a game of grains and barn finds  
Waning deities and recursive lullabies  
Stocking your pains on the shelf  
Documenting your mind  
All the tame tides are flowing and you  
Are swimming away from yourself  
  
I will never find you in functions  
Hidden in the curve  
You are too nerve wracked  
For calculation  
Too living and breathing  
To relate to this  
Fabricated sense  
For basically once  
You will get what you deserve  
After having primitivised you, idolised you from afar  
I will make a sudden apparition  
And pulling the lens horribly out of focus  
You will laugh at my definition  
  
I will find you on Holy Roman roads  
That rise to nowhere  
You will be tumbling off the sides of  
A collapsing cloudline  
Hurtling landward  
To the wet evergreens of mountainshoulders  
Evening the treeline  
Even the living daylights, the tails  
Of brave scavengers will be shaken  
And as for those below  
No cloak to call their own  
Shivering bones  
In archaeological poses  
Seeing the wild electricity of it all  
The continent in seizure  
Columns and friezes  
The stamina and structure of the heavens  
Shattering conclusively  
Pillars and parapets  
Blown by the wind  
We will never know  
The roads are broken  
How are you still on the go?  
  
I will visit you in the Leopold Museum  
In Death and Life  
I will see you as a hidden riddle  
The glue binding the saturated fabric  
Between the necks and elbows  
Of my family  
A dragon-shaped river of lava  
Oscillating safe as granite beneath our footsteps  
How muscular we make you out to be!  
You are in bulging patterns in the giddy colours of daytime but you are also  
In the blue, a hidden clue  
  
After years on the run from food  
I will find you in a thickened stew  
And give my blessings to the chef  
We don't have many meals together left  
I am footfall on the silk road  
Under Arabian Nights  
No matter how happy I am to receive you  
How thrilling the view  
I will still kill you in the morning  
To keep you out of my sight  
  
There used to be statues of you  
Until I blew off your head  
Shards of marble have gone flying  
You are being redistributed in death
