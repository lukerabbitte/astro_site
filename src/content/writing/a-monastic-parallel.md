The stream at Buile an Araltraigh drains Wicklow into Dublin. On a hot spring day running shirtless to the source. Rough secondhand rucksack strap fraying in the motion. Its silvery threads dropping plastic crumb trails on the sand, studying every crinkle and divot on my hand, every strain on the webbing, every pearly nail and scale powering beneath the sailing plane of midday. Stretching outwards from the wintery foetal position in full gallop, enjoying the movement, slick on the skin, regaining the heat of a sun that has remembered how high up it can go.

Exchanging ideas in my head, lapping up the brainy, idle waters and five minutes later slapped on the face of an incline. Latent mental activity waiting incandescently. Running into a wall of focus. Nothing loud around the river. Running until I run myself into concentration. Hoping that I never escape capering away from waymarked trails with an empty stomach, proud chest, stoic face. Idling river of white noise as I tumble into tirelessness. The grandest feasts are cooked on empty stomachs. Is maith an t-anlann.

Seasonal highs in the amphitheatre of County Wicklow, the monastic silence of Magheramore. Soaking wet, brown leaves flooring St. Kevin's Tower, flecked with wishful hidden euros in the eaves. Throw a coin for the hope that our water keeps flowing. Cooling now, Glendasan Valley's dissappearing water-hole, it only pools in good humour. Inns at loggerheads in Roundwood that only fill in high summer. Driving off the edge of Ireland on Military Road, the forceful tumult. Liquid synths on the car stereo. We are the music makers. Walking the gorge at Laragh, backflipping the pier in town, bivvying under pellets of rain in Inchivore. Lighting pieces of damp Wicklow gorse on fire. Scrubbing our pots with Country Wicklow water, an Tobar Segais.

Whispering fluidly it runs through purple heather. It cleans our teeth. Close the door and drift by tonight. Let your soul haunt the revolutionaries at Glenmalure, let your eyewater flow and your glassy skin dry. Run yourself back into that wall but in the name of all those gall-thirsty throats, make notes of your mourning, make like water your journey.
