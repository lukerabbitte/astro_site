We sold the time the clockface told  
In printed numbers painted bold  
We pulled these ropes down from the sky  
Our naked hands on downward twine  
Ask us where the bedrock cracked  
It's getting hard to answer back  
That fickle instrumental heat that  
Cracked and burned these innards black  
  
Ask if we might celebrate this  
Hallowed day before it slips  
Away and into open air  
But kindly leave this field of dreams as  
Fallow as a concrete brick  
We'll send a picture just to prove  
That we were here to witness it  
The dying of the dream and then  
We'll ask you have you seen the shallow  
Space beneath your heavy shadow  
  
Celebrate this in a song  
An air to speed the evening on  
See the darkness out the door  
And cheer the heady sparks along  
  
So long it said and on and on  
Instead of doing nothing wrong  
And ominously wasting time  
Anonymously speaking to the air  
With something preprepared  
And creeping slowly up the stairs  
And greeted by a freezing stare  
An evening collapsed into a night that barely even cares  
A song that beckons you to stay  
In longing for escape from something  
Easily explained away  
And hardly ever argued over  
Under our ecstatic grin  
We spill the purest water  
In our scramble for the sweeter things  
How soft and silent disbelieves  
Decaying on the autumn leaves  
Intelligence is only worth the hope  
It gives to those in need  
So even as it decomposes  
Tell yourself the story that you've  
Chose and put your home and clothes  
And everything you own behind  
  
There's something coursing through the streets  
That keeps our feet forever planted  
Outside all your swarming footfall  
Over all you take for granted  
Over all these prices paying  
Losing all the games you're playing  
  
And moving on from pointless love  
We're circling away above  
The coldness that kept us up waiting  
Searching, dodging, half-explaining  
Anchored in imagination  
Oscillating dots on paper  
Operating on the faker  
Sense of being celebrated  
Maybe every second day  
If somewhere in this holding bay  
An angel swept down from above  
To say that it would be okay  
  
Expensive cameras taking shots  
Of what the city is and was  
The shots are wacky, somewhat blurred  
It's like they'd never heard a lick  
Of all the people living here that  
Pick their battles as they pick their  
Instruments up for the ghosts  
Of friends they never held so close  
  
They play to pay the cosmic cost  
For fear of turning back to violence  
Praying that they don't get tossed  
Aside or lost among the silence  
  
Humans are the sole composers  
Openers and closers of the doors  
That darkness bolts between  
The seers into the unseen  
Our education needs to stay  
It cannot come another day  
It cannot come in boxes made to  
Shrink these songs to memory  
  
The only thing more dangerous  
Than unnecessary opulence  
Is placing all your hope in  
This directionless intelligence  
You ask us time and time again  
To point towards the place it cracked  
It's getting even harder  
To pretend to send an answer back  
Tell us pay the price of getting  
Older as the city smoulders  
Tell us as the clock ticks on  
And keep on looking past our shoulders
