Aerial and powerful  
Is how art should make you feel  
Aerial and powerful  
A watcher of a field of  
Flowers full of seeds  
  
Your family tree inks your handsome  
Masculine face  
You can't track or trace or erase or cremate  
Them but they made you go through them  
Like a garden begging for birds  
  
Possessions tell the age from the forefingers  
Tingling keys and tickets in your coat pocket  
Like a foreigner looking for the sidelines of home  
Looking for anyone they know  
On the rollcall  
  
Art should give a clue  
To skip the long queue to get into  
Like the mood you're in when making food changes it  
Plastic melts into the most incredible fake stages of colour  
Puddling under whatever daily clouds forcefield over it  
  
Living between the cracks and classes  
Massively off balance  
The ladybird in your mind's eye  
Flies into the green light of the world  
  
You are nothing but a gaily set mudslinger  
Seeing the evidence of your favourite beliefs everywhere  
Amazing how the fingers learn to fling  
Like against like  
Until it bruises  
And admits an oozing silver light  
Trilling through filthy catacomb slivers  
  
The five pillars crack upon will  
Like a waiting oak  
Attending its acorns  
And from the classification's rot  
Erupt the ladybirds  
Evading the disagreeable  
Flying across the foreseeable  
Future seasons  
To a skinlike feeling  
Of being breathing
