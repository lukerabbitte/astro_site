Real life is an optical table  
A tale of laserlike focus  
Then dormancy  
Real life doesn't announce itself  
It happens  
Real life forms in thin air  
In our ruminating human being heads  
One-above-the-rest obsessed  
When we long to be elsewhere  
And look  
Nobody springs the locks of real life gamely  
Knowing where to seek  
The growing hair along  
Dark winter roots  
Without declaring that it isn't fair  
  
Real life is happening in its titular cities  
  
Real life is the keen edge of breath  
Cutting through your throat  
How it can send you reeling  
In real life you are at the reins  
But off the road  
A hurler on the ditch  
Real life is timely, named and spread out thinly  
Shaped in strange ways across acres  
Strategies to sear dates into your frying pan memory  
  
Real life is under the seasoning of two dishes  
Put into the one pot  
And cooked  
Our first life is dull till sharpened seconds remain  
Only as strong as the heartbeat beneath  
The mucous producing membranes, slick,  
How thick the animal skin to illness  
How skilled the hands  
To build demand  
Forgiving the bones to stillness  
How keen the peregrine falconer eye  
Lights up the sky  
In surveillance  
How you breath in a chamber  
When, thousands of patterns a day later,  
You are sent away to a frail manger  
To be born again  
  
Real life is starsailing through space with friends  
A colossus rowing home  
Throwing pupils round the colosseum  
Bearing eachother  
To the furthest nadir  
Even when in apartments  
To which real life is  
Economically contained  
Real life is real company  
Seriously outpeering ourselves  
But laughing because everyone's still here
