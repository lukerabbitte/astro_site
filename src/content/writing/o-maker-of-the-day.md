You're all the hours in the day  
You're all the words I can say  
And the ones I stay away from  
You're a faraway prayer in haste  
You rose from the east  
And left us beggars on the trail  
You're the sunlit drumlin to a burning city  
You're the postman's daughter  
You're the fish in the sea  
You're the heat on our face  
The cruel chink of light through the cell  
You're the mystery of my faith  
You're the watcher of the skies  
The waiter at the station  
The moon-facing patient  
The on-off switch  
You are all the hours in the day  
You are the years it takes to learn to live  
And the second that deletes it  
You're infinity to the rodent mind  
The next best thing  
You are the closest we can get  
You are the mountain at my gates  
You are the pebble in my shoe  
You're the machine, the screen between  
The screaming mother  
The scaliest skin  
The coldness, the confusion  
The freezing of the soil  
The wilting of the leaves  
The processor  
The referee  
The killer of things  
The multiplier of cancers  
The slider of the beads through fingers  
The computer that stores the answers  
You are the memory of murmuring heartbeats  
The prints we left upon the track  
You are the turner of tides  
The washer of hair  
Receiver of prayer  
The bringer of things  
The watcher in the wings  
The wingspan of the universe  
You're flying parallel to us  
But you're always out of reach  
You're all the hours in the day  
You are the price of the earth  
You are the price of the smile  
On my face  
You are every question  
We asked as kids we've forgotten  
You are the on-off switch  
The opting in and the opting out  
You're all the hours we have left  
You're all the hours in the day  
You're all the hours in the day  
You're all we have left  
You cost the earth  
But keep us spinning  
You cost the earth  
But keep us spinning  
You are the reason why we keep on singing  
You're all the years  
You're all the months  
You're all the days  
You're all the hours  
You're all the minutes  
You're every second  
You're the on-off switch  
You're everything I wanted to say  
In a language in decay  
You're everything I want to say  
In a language in decay  
You're the maker of the day  
You're the maker of the day  
You're the maker of the day  
You're the maker of the day  
You're the maker of the day  
You're the maker of the day  
You're the maker of the day  
You're the maker of the day
