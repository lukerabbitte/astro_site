Clothes won't fold under this old mouldy cone roof  
Clone me so you can throw the old me in a lonely phonebooth  
To say hello to those who told me nobody would listen closely  
Openly denying my entire magnum opus seeking  
Reasons to believe in something bigger than themselves  
A prepackaged religion left to rot upon the shelves  
Only smouldering white dwarves and shells cooling off  
Until it's back into the smoking barrel  
Broken bending and it's getting worse  
In the shapeless wasteland written in free verse  
Like, what an awful ending to the universe  
Sickening yet truly instinctual methods  
To preserve life by clinging onto the loose edges  
Cold denizens need somewhere to sleep  
When they're out there on their beat creeping  
Sweeping past the obvious evidence and  
Never referencing or even merely whispering defeat  
Seeking comfort in discrete manners  
Wave your banners and go bananas when the white flag being raised is all that matters  
This mad hatter's light scatters around  
Scavenger's dens in the dead of night  
In the hinterlands detonating payloads  
Laying loads, saying loads of empty stuff and praying that it explodes  
Golden glory days hidden within a song   
The rhythms you couldn't ever put your finger on  
  
The strangers stay away from danger till somebody screams  
Curdled chicken guts spilling out on television screens  
Wicked burglars running to and fro if memory is  
Serving me correctly in this circulated history  
Commonly told yet comically old  
A comic book sold on the premise of what we already know  
Go slowly and pore over the worst told joke  
In the world it's totally worth a token whirl  
Take control of everything you get your fingers on  
Slovenly dressed but longing for whatever happens next  
Barking up the wrong tree  
Tripping over the borrowed moccasins I been putting on the wrong feet  
Sleek feeling Portuguese leather in hand  
Of course the orchard thieves would torch the trees throwing up their hands  
Anything to stay away from the scorching brand  
Get stung or flown away and searched for in the foreign lands  
  
Shake hands and come to a conclusion swiftly  
Under a shifting illusion I saw the light clearly  
Playing out and snaking underground trying to reach nearly  
Let me wrap my head around the world before I speak sincerely  
You know the sort of things we're never meant to see in person  
I could never remember what day it was when I was working  
Scheming plotting far from all the jarring light beams  
He dreams every second starry night or so it seems  
  
So here comes the back-up-to-earthening  
Circling overhead and splitting the air worshipping  
Most things that tumble straight out of what we put em in  
Stumbling down repeatedly ad nauseum  
Museum quality love was always the main mission  
No qualms watering down what came bounding between two mad hatted  
Infatuated accomplices   
Who'll never know what the damn hurry is
