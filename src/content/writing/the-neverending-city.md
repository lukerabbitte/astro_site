I looked down  
The neverending city  
The clotted gravel harassing  
Dolphin riverbends  
Starts with a cold swinging riddle  
My love is a riding horse  
The colour of sand  
And the fizzle of charcoal  
Ground down  
A mountain sound that travelled down  
  
The manmade pictures of it in my head  
The strange vocabulary of dreaming  
Twists through temples  
I paint my meadow brown  
Plainly  
Never to be phrased  
  
Palaces I build on separating ground to fling the  
Echoes of friends around  
Offering the proudest  
Sizeable deposit  
My mind could contrive  
I slid  
And continue to slide  
  
Thumped on mountainbacks  
Foreign stones stuck in these fissures  
A father telling the truth to his son  
On a lump of a motherlike mountain  
Cozy in my identity  
Cooling the head in snow-found  
Profound cold  
  
A sacrifice of polygons  
Across cathedral turns  
Christening  
The long beams pink  
Across shrinking  
Parks of completeness  
The glistening lattice of balconies  
The glad feeling of sinking  
Your roots sink into a moodless ground  
And making no sound
