You picked the wrong religion on a whim when you were young.  
You licked your lips and kissed the words in spirit and in tongue.  
You kicked around so urgently until the deed was done.  
Evicted from your sickly frame the process had begun.  
  
I think the one thing worse than being kicked out of your home  
Is being forced to live in one you never truly own  
A skeleton constructed from the brittlest of bone  
Shrivelling and broken at the footstool of the throne  
  
You lost the game and realised the forfeit wasn't nice -  
An orphan in a fortress, now a prisoner in disguise.  
When the dream was dead you threw your head back to the skies,  
Between two darknesses you found a light that hit your eyes.  
  
You picked the thing but never thought to pick the thing apart.  
You picked when it was easy, only now it's getting hard.  
You sat down with the sacred texts but found them imprecise -  
You picked the wrong religion once, and now you've picked it twice.
