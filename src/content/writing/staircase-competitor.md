Loud stuff spouted in dandelion outbursts  
Out and overflowing over interlocking open seasons  
Hesitation ensnared  
Rehearsed and prepared  
To read violence into this stare  
To sing silence into the air  
  
An object falling down a drain  
The tide comes in and out again  
As naming aimless miseries  
Stumbling tingling mysteries  
Lay dangling on the whispery  
Commitments of the peasantry  
  
Damage served so heavy handed  
Land your boots on candid sand  
And spit your heady memorabilia  
Readying to understand  
That you and you alone have planned  
To keep your faith in talismans  
So don't go floundering around  
Stupidly entangled in the boundless possibillities  
A stranded panther bounding down  
The plains of his own hunting ground  
In horror at the slightest sound  
  
Indefinitely succeeded  
By your heartening technology  
I dangle in suspense of action  
Scared to voice my stupefaction  
Listening to those who move  
In carefully redacted factions  
Acting casually as if the  
Earth we muck around on and the  
Air that begs for empathy and  
Waterfalls at different speeds  
And everything just randomly  
Played out in simple acts of three  
  
So softly and invisibly  
Your eyes are staring back at me  
It's getting harder to believe  
In timelines to the contrary  
I'm choking in and clawing deep  
And breathing out convincingly  
In flickering intensity  
I fill the air indelibly
