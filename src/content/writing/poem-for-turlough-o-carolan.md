I am different things to different people  
I am unfunnelable to the last drop  
I sit with royalty  
Kings and other things  
Do my best to unstop stoppers  
Swap my Aesops for their coppers  
I have nothing more to offer.  
  
Raise your eyebrows if you like!  
But tonight I am raising my glass to Turlough O'Carolan  
Warlock of the harp  
All man hopes is to become the shorthand for something  
To be at a fast arm's reach  
Reachable from every facet  
Of a fascinatingly speech and mind defined  
Multidimensional breach of kinds  
The fact that each and every  
Person's point of time along a line  
Branches forth so undefinably  
Is something that has taken a while for me  
To pack my breathing dreams between  
  
But Turlough,  
Thickly spread through balding pages  
Are our pages thickening?  
Every pulse at a seat at this table is quickening  
How sickeningly sometimes are the flickerings out of  
People we were glad to be visiting  
I am always glad to visit people for a while  
But I often curse the five mile walk back to mine  
When their touch turns cold  
My soul on coals is a told-too-boldly mold  
But I have never felt as old as in the withholding of a smile  
A road home I didn't rise to meet  
Nor it me  
We want to feel well designed  
Spinally secure  
Well skeletally fleshed over but  
Some goodbyes are final  
Turlough O'Carolan,  
Something in you is endless to me.  
  
But of course, I'm different things to different people  
And I suppose you were too.  
I am visiting you for a while  
And taking what I need and I'm sorry if that seems obscene but I am behind a screen  
And this is not as easy as it seems  
  
You left us sitting spare in the aftermath  
Waiting for the next pluck of song from thin air  
And didn't even care  
Sentinels were paid to feign witness to your frame  
While your soul itself escaped  
Turlough O'Carolan, light in the air  
Dark to the gut  
This is why we can't cut the cords  
  
Liking the hardness of the harp  
We shoot guessing arrows  
Nobody knows who built what  
We forlornly court this device from outside  
Shortly to sort the seeing from the blind  
Sunburned kids living three islands behind  
Asking the same thing at different times  
We consist not just of croaking joins  
Of chopped wood but the focus  
Of the mind  
The history of the world  
The mystery of nighttime  
Skies and what we're yet to find  
We shake the constellations just to  
Try and make them look alive  
We are food in the belly of something  
In every field of view  
Every piece of sinew lying askew  
Will flex anew  
  
We fling strings and other things  
Our artefacts and instincts  
And wish our rattling fervour outward  
All the sights that you earned  
From a thing beyond words...  
Sensational!  
  
I could have as equally raised a glass for the harp itself  
And all its disciples  
In the name of every loved-one-under-the-sun-spent day  
But I am deciding to be specific and so tonight  
I am drinking a glass for Turlough O'Carolan  
A man I never met  
Passersby in this old country  
Will hear him and weep  
I am passing by him for a while  
Now you are passing by me
