Your hope did croak it so  
Hopelessly as the useless toolkit too duplicated  
Worn down the worse for having abdicated  
In distance as we watched and waited  
In yellow ochre worldly pallet fastening  
Embracing every last thought palace falling  
Into contaminated place all hallows  
Faced with the evening of the days  
Levelling pearlescent on the gaze  
Unfazed and indoctrinated ways  
Of spin doctors populating opulent pages  
Of opposition payment-waived sages  
Saving caged animosity operation blame game  
Obligated to regard the obvious with animation  
In actuality it came instead  
Of what we sat expecting  
Watching waiting blaming tasting  
Rusty flaking broken engine  
Standing in extremity  
The whistle blows up from the basement  
Truth arrives and always ends  
In tears and wishing you'd been patient  
  
Oozing out of every early  
Oeuvre till it lost its nerve  
Was flickered fire illustrating  
Gleeful in asphyxiation  
Unabated celebration  
Unabashed acceleration  
Unabridged improvisation  
Undeterred configuration  
All the things explained before  
A pact was hammered out on paper  
Hoping that it never tore  
Or tapered into evermore  
  
Standing in extremity  
It hears the ancient mission statement  
Truth arrives to terrorise  
The space where unchained dreams reside  
But holding this pathetic piece of theatre to candlelight  
Reveals the dusty ode to crumble  
Rotting down to nothing and then  
Lost amid the roaring sands  
Buried by the harmattans  
  
Hope is holding on to lemon branches in Val√®ncia  
And shaking till the locus holds us captive in absentia  
Hopefully I'll see you under light of day eventually  
From watching waiting overhead we start the disassembly
