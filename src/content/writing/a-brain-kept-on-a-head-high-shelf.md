A brain kept on a head-high shelf  
A brain according to itself  
A signal parser, letter getting  
Thing that thinks it's getting better  
Go and tell your overlord that  
All we ever made we stored in here  
Among the knots and folds  
The one place left for us to go  
When all the cans that we've been kicking  
Down the road explode and set our  
Flickering designs awry  
And then we'll see what's left behind  
  
A brain that seemed to simmer down  
The last time scooped up off the ground  
A brain gets offered in the name  
Of other ones that did the same  
Get it in your hands and feel the commonness-as-dirt of it  
The produce-of-the-earth of it  
The comments that you made with it  
Feel its cold slush in a hush  
It's not like we're in any rush  
Give some pushes, give some prys  
Tell it some amazing lies  
Tell it that its fight for life  
Sets skies alight, a spark that settled  
Squarely in the layman's sights  
Rested in the sunken night  
  
A brain that cannot tell the time is moving on  
Moving on  
Under all the weight it's been a pillar since the very start  
It's really no surprise that every now and then it breaks your heart  
Take it in your hands to be the fool  
That chose to fight this tool  
  
A brain that moves, a brain that speaks  
An instrument that's out of reach  
A brain that slots things into order  
Dark and bulging dream absorber  
Someone lost, another murdered  
Those who went that one bit further  
  
Act like it's the enemy  
Until you sense it's meant to be  
The blade that lets you fight your way  
To wishing wells of searing light
