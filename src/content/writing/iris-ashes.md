Iris ashes far sing  
Appellations at the highest courts  
Whistling the truth  
Clubbing the bell  
She steals south  
Running lipid and undissolvable  
In the foreign liquid  
Potent until her point is proven  
Surging like the vernacular bell rung  
Tongue-like  
Flushing what wrung  
Out from the constellation  
Note of fluency  
Concerningly clear  
Mote of credence blown through  
Bloated trees moving congruently  
Singling eachother out  
The earth fills her daughter's hands  
Her eyes spill along the hills  
Grinning and  
Clasped to the best chance  
Of winning  
Like the earth survives off the sun  
And other stars  
Lead a light to believe it  
Sees the thing it really needs  
Shouting to the congregation from a boulder  
On a depressed ditch  
Exchanging feelings  
Shedding a colder sealed deal  
For the bold firestarter  
Morningstar  
No portly carriage  
Carving up the meals  
To give her steely carriage  
Coursing passage  
Day design  
And way making  
The vacant corporeal  
  
Courting morning  
She builds temporal freewheels  
Like a large cannon of love  
Shooting the gorgeous peppering  
Enormous targets  
A year off course  
  
Like a spiderweb by a lake  
She catches dawn's creepings  
Shakes down the living creatures  
Drowns them all with a tincture  
Made to stay the aesthetic nation  
Godly as an athletic gardener  
With a million co-existing wonders  
Springing and crisscrossing  
Under and overgrowth  
Hoping that the ten hundred thousandth  
Apparatus to the grand machination  
Twists into a leafy corpse correctly  
In the hanging aberration gardens  
Love falls off-course  
The spider eats the final force-fed morsel of discourse  
Gorgeously  
  
Dragging  
From the most transient  
Disgusting and low ditches  
To hit a ding off the plate  
Of poverty  
To kill a phage, pest, or plague  
And one day to raise your ears  
To the reverberant wash of safety  
Memory is a place you'd spend your whole life  
Trying to recreate
