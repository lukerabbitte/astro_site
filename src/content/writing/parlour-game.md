Speak for hours on end, why not?  
Let that ambivalence sing  
Weigh in with triple checked phrasing, tumble out and  
Double check it twice again  
Let that disgusting naivety spill out on the floor  
Guts and all  
Sometimes your voice might create a pallid mist  
Or a breathy heat  
But most of the time it sits tepid and soggy  
Croaking its way into existence  
Stealing away with resistance  
Too particular for the blanket banality of a world  
That groans with solidity everywhere  
As your invisible voice greets the air  
Maybe if you resign to  
Open your mouth periodically  
Deliver opinions episodically  
Construct your outbursts melodically  
Rehearse your rhetoric harmonically  
Outsmart your physiology  
Connect the dots backhandedly  
Dive into complexity  
And swim off with audacity  
You'll win your game convincingly  
You'll slip away in secrecy
