The linen of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, the possessions of the prince-bishopric. An excellently executed portrait of Sister Germanface on Fronleichnam day carrying forth the body of Christ into the cold town. The Loisach is dribbling with salmon tonight and they are cold on the tongue. For what licked Fionn? In periodic gnaw, circumnavigating thawing fought-for winter well water well asked after and sought for, the cold melt frustrates us.

Garmisch, I shall be brief because tomorrow your bishops and the corpus christi canter the streets. You have caught the alpine disease. The meadow elves stay two centuries away in stakeout in the trees. Suspicious of the sale of compact life, the Lidl edition. Nothing fresco about your worship, all is beheld indoors. Catamarans of granite, rugpinches of elven soil and the mortifying caskets of icemen are surrounding your town and you will never break the siege. Finn Eces remotely preparing, all the time preparing for wisdom but still never gets a lick. The great soul of the age spread go fairsing moves to the next Tobar Segais under age-old siege. The road rage of the unfree. Oh great overflier, flatten us to roads and see!

Ecce homunculus ; raised in spermy pseudoscience in hail mary animation he betrays his mother and creates a fork. Fork number eight billion. Persistently forking and doing everything again. The son's son sets orange warning on his son - "in front is the really real but all you see of yourself is in your rear facing face, a component of the history of the world is all you see in your image, this is the road rage of the free, I think and think and fight and fork and I end up back in my barefeet; I will only ever believe what I see".

It is my special addiction to travel two towns over and still be me and honestly I could escape the borough and the era and awake two centuries ago and still not find peace. I find peace starting anew on the blue Danube until a drunk man butchers the tune, cudgels the mood.

A Night in Ensconcia. Moving slow over great distances we kick up timeless earth. Overflowing Danube carrying us to Cassiopeia. Conditions of carriage have never been clear. Fastened in the suspended occult. Little caregivers career and swim here. You exist there and here, then you disappear.
