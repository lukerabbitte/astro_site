They say history is for winners  
Authority balks at the altar of sinners  
The timeline unspooling the safety of distance  
Our stumbling movements unstoppable pistons  
  
You float in and out of a sense of achievement  
While channelling rivers of comfortable movement  
Yet over the tumult you hear someone say  
Above is the power; above it will stay.  
  
Their statues are built on the floodplains of others  
Ascendancy stems from the bloodstains of mothers  
The ledger omits the pain it avoids  
Til the whimpers drift up from blackening voids  
  
Still, songs are coughed up from the scratchiest throats  
A ballet in action, humanity floats  
Though our glorious wingspan is hastily clipped  
Anonymous authors are writing the script  
  
The bells serenading our human expenses  
Keep ringing beyond our wildest pretences  
We try to recover in plausible verse  
This misunderstanding too wide to traverse  
  
Our words are unwieldy, rectangular houses  
For triangular tenants with circular spouses  
They float in and out of our flickering sight  
What's light in the morning grows heavy by night  
  
Rectangular wrecks are greeting the divers  
The malleable tenants the only survivors  
They rose to the air with a story to tell  
A song of observance, a song of farewell  
  
Their riddles were built on a lack of resolving  
Their motors were keeping the heavens revolving  
Their heat introducing a brilliance evolving  
Their produce fermenting in darkness dissolving
