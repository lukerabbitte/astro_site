I have a fathomless cabinet  
That opens too soon  
It is a one way action  
Depositing proudly  
Won memories and well wrought  
Words, winking wishing well coins plummeting  
Creatively inward  
And the pinhole above  
Blinking and blurring as we run out  
No matter how deep this cavity booms  
It is encircled  
There are things on the perimeter we never thought we'd see  
That made us feel complete  
We are encircled totally  
We sprint to the edges but by some deflecting  
Guiding watchful eye the sky provides  
Some controllers of the flocculi  
Sizing up our decision  
Deign to steady our vision  
A magnet contradicts us and we deflect  
Right back to centre  
Feel as though we never left  
We cannot run out  
Infinity seems believable  
  
We are so sure of it from this point of view  
So unknowing of our misfortune  
We soar ignorantly through  
We like not to crane our heads to light  
Wrung from a gush of fuel in the night  
A glowing field just out of sight  
No, instead we stay put  
With zero subtlety  
Count winnings on our hands  
Empty the stash  
Splash into the fibreoptics and  
Feel as though we are spanning something  
In the firing of a synapse  
The relapse of delusion  
We take our hollow victory laps  
  
The well and good symbolically  
Collapse outside the song  
Although I yearn for freedom  
I will miss this when it's gone  
  
A handful of ruddy cheeked children of the dawn  
Spawning what's to come  
What's to come?  
We were relaxing in a field of flaxseed  
Under a sky blue parasol  
Summoning all the viscous joy  
Our brains could smuggle  
The earth bulging at our hipbones  
Careering sunward  
Dirt in our nails  
Work cut out for eachother  
Elementary fools whose feeble  
Dreams smothered their burgeoning features  
Bulging hills will rollercoaster these flat fields  
The plain will become salient  
We will have become well seasoned by then  
In a faded haze, arcs of light will glance off these days  
In a guilt trip gaze  
Me and you with the grain  
In a softening maze  
I will miss this in every single way  
  
From the lining of this basket  
To outside where I belong  
I have never felt so strong but  
Still I'll miss you when you're gone  
  
I will drain you from my veins one day  
I am terrified to think of all the  
Cells that you supply  
I wonder how many times  
You and I stared eye to eye  
Retina to retina, me focusing your likeness  
Into my own minds eye  
Grey matter documentation  
You in my image  
I never got the full picture  
I've seen the seedlings grow  
To trees  
I've sweated through all of these breezes in your wake  
Thanking christ that it was only a dream  
Tranquilising myself back to sleep  
Harpoons will plummet to the deep  
We'll feel the weight of water  
Steal the firmness of our feet  
We'll leave no treasure behind  
No matter how much we tried to keep  
Just because it's natural  
Doesn't bring relief  
Someone might come fishing for history's sake  
But we will most likely perish wishing  
Deployed on separate missions  
Staring there, eye to eye,  
And we forget to say goodbye  
God almighty, we will always play for the same team but for now  
You are on the other side  
  
You closed the door discretely  
Like silence all along  
Was all we had recorded  
I will miss you when you're gone  
  
You fill me up with latent hope  
The glancing of a beam against  
A cloud of fizzing isotopes  
A planet and an antidote  
  
You read me incompletely  
Like nothing all along  
Had really been discovered  
I will miss you when you're gone  
  
You're not the same as truth  
But you're unfalsified against my eyes  
You'll never be more right than wrong  
But still I'll miss you when you're gone
