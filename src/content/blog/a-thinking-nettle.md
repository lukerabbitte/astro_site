Amid the grey heft he was pushed under thundering voices again  
Signage placed deftly around the wandering pen  
Like life and livestock ran through the pen  
In the gallery singing voices cut through the fizzing  
Gurgling voice of a very old friend -  
"We have the right to pretend -  
We are stubborn as old books, the potential to learn something incendiary  
Burnt bold in our pages  
We are small and adventurous,  
Like sores insisting the world"  
From somewhere peripheral he hears  
Exquisitely tuned organs cheating the brain  
Of its last endorphin  
Beating its way unyielding homeward  
To the outgrown orphan.  
  
He flinches once.  
  
When he was younger he was also pushed under the throngs  
Trying to find a right wrong toÂ trick everybody  
Head between the hipbones of others  
When it rained he saw how like everything  
The passersby returned to dirt  
To panic  
To shelter  
The sky's spine parsing  
Plains emptied in record time  
And a companionship of people migrating towards better design  
  
His mind had grown coarse on this course  
It wasn't like the first taste  
The taste of sawdust, industrial waste  
Refuse the bed, screaming strange blessings over his head  
Gunning his philtrum, drumming his temple and making  
Altogether bollocks of his head  
No, this was the slow wane instead  
A clumsier episode  
Benchsitting in a park  
Waiting for someone, wanting for some kind mollifying mind to help him find  
A spark in the dark -  
An arc not a lark.  
  
You're after losing your youth  
Say the old,  
Like any appendage you're after not using  
It is in critical atrophy  
Effortless zephyr detritus.  
  
He is encountered again,  
But in the heat of the moment he stands  
Squarely and categorically.  
The only thing worse than this categorical belt  
To the head was the vacillating dread,  
The flinch from the previous.  
Can't duck from your own head, son.  
Ingenious!  
Drag your sunset mind far from the line  
To a kinder disobedience  
To find beauty in the Orient instead.  
  
Wax temples dot the country:  
The potential to make something incendiary  
Incentivised away  
"We stick to furthering our calamity, de-escalating into  
The core of God's green earth and yelling as we go,  
All the better for our rescuers  
Wishing these feeble pulses upward, Godspeed,  
Attracting the attention of our train  
And one day spewing from pit to plain  
Where less things need to be explained  
And lesser things take the hint.  
Filling a cave with echolocation  
Bellowing to echolocate our toil  
To the prompted audience monitoring the pit's mouth  
Whose enqueued applause emerges on cue - how do you fight back?!"  
Between one resonance, smooth and shaping idle walls in rising booms  
And another shocked down in tragic high pass, ignoring the lows even as it descends,  
He knows what he'd choose.  
  
Looking love in the face  
Becoming as inconvenienced in each other's grip,  
As swaying mates on New Year's Eve  
"More hope finding blue smoke in my Northern Lights eyes  
Than your fawning auras in the West  
Your gaudy opal dawns,  
Your sunsets pink and futile, nights auroraborealis-less  
Through the vector of my eyes  
The storm petrel flies  
On a freehand horizon  
Let not your hands rise disjunctly,  
Jagged from one drag to the next  
And croaking in conflict  
But in intelligent, joint writing,  
Blissful unison, flux of the youth  
The growing of tactics to face facts with!"  
He and it are like parables drawn ambiently  
The cultivation of echoes, sound  
On arable, tenable grounds  
The surrounding enclosures drawn not by plan  
But by doodling hand  
  
His body is bread, ground through the unthinking belly in no small allusion to Christ  
His life toast - doomed to a crisp on both sides  
But to be plain  
His hopes for the future remain  
Positively insane  
He, child of nobody  
Winner of the freedom  
Of anonymity  
Not for lack of an old fashioned hack  
No chance of ma spinning him anklewise  
Across the sitting room,  
Striking granda's clock  
All handsome and shattering  
Dangling in shock  
At the time laid aground  
Like a strange vessel  
Sinking without a sound  
A thinking nettle  
Nobody could grasp their palms around  
No chance of sitting on da's shoulders  
Seeing the bigger things at a head height  
No more small things at close quarters  
In this sort of order  
Never to feel the windpipe clutching  
Over some touching  
Half-remembered chat  
In a Tuesday kitchen  
The fading waft of details  
Someone baking flapjacks  
On a whim and whistling  
The gist of a half remembered air  
His head in a snare  
Things get a bit unfair here and there and  
In fairness  
He has felt the old cold and croaking lump jump out of his gullet on rare occasion since  
But yet he spills containerlessly outwards  
Still  
At a snail's crawling pace in Myrtleville  
Over the waves of children shrill and shrieking  
Running neck deep in the swell  
For the thrill, the seeking tides of things  
That never rang a bell to him  
Horizons spanned in freehand  
Expanding into somethingness  
Petrels heading home in navigation in the weightlessness  
Sand is running through his fingers, he the heir of everything  
Waiting namelessly for all the mystery worth visiting
