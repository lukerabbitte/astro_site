The ink that mints the most
Incredible things
Cozens me
This ink is the ink
In which I all the same dream I swim
I could spend a stint thinking
The shiny stinging fragment
In my pinker brain splinters
For kindling
To deny the growing night
To sink in filling succour
But I would be giving myself a fright

On the crescent moon of a beach
The cloaked pearl of the earth
I woke up
I gathered myself ab incunabulis
Nothing that nacreous awaits
After this

Even though they sing the most
Incoherent tune
I will eat their wicked croon book soon
Sing it back in chapters
Starting from the cruel scrubbing of the
Eyeballs on a beach in June
On a beach
That is next to the sea
And something about the moon
Slotting almost halfway through a groove
In your apelike flail
On a trail you know
You move through
Twinkling like the old world postman
Moving mail to the present
Capering through a fresh air ocean
As the seafood inhales
Lips peel paper off the seal
On the ink blue night
You brood
Elbows glued boringly to the gunwale

That sickening single inkling fool
Tracing the twenty year scaffold
With an one-handed tool
Will learn anew
How they painted all the best blue pictures of the sea
Many miles from home
And soundings from ease
