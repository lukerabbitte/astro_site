40 days since our last accident  
We have been looking at the same food in new ways  
Since we parted ways  
We chewed through uncountably infinite days  
To get at the pith  
We sipped from-concentrate-juice in a queue  
Juggling away the fruit  
Distractions through the roof  
Cutting bizarre shapes to fall through  
Praying for a scare to attend to  
A fall from a parapet  
We were well schooled and God almighty  
Could you even see us inference-filled to the brim  
Reverence soaked to the skin  
When we decided to reference eachother  
Life as a pair is rare  
We are warm in the bearing of eachother  
When we eventually get there  
  
We yelled and they stared,  
"Behold the cheating heart of artists!"  
Getting the better of people  
Competing with and beating people  
  
She to me is a figure of speech  
A tale of three  
We believed in small acts of genius  
Freedom and bread in the same bedstead  
The lack of saviours  
And the delusion of victory  
In the evening I'd brush my teeth and mere winks from sleep I'd jump from here to there and go  
"Say to me is there a single thing  
The eye can see that the mind can't flee?"  
Thinking I was on the brink  
Two blinks removed from a cosmic fishtank  
Do we thank the food or the feeder?  
We tasted both flavours but settled on neither  
Swimming darkly towards the receiver  
  
I watch myself losing focus  
I am just another child  
Awake in the night  
Waiting for a scare  
Waiting and waiting and waiting  
And there's nobody there  
In the middle of the wilderness  
A moon glows away from me  
Detailing, rocky, empty  
Cold and fitful in the ether  
Tonight  
Terrible things are happening here  
How soon you grow away from me  
I tell the fiend to stay  
Seven hells away from me  
We were stuck out there with not a single bite to eat  
Thinking no earthly fuss could tempt us prematurely  
We learned to listen to how our half sleep-deprived minds  
Rode the early day's waves on the line of best fit  
Picking a tune from a Rhodes in a sunlit cesspit  
A mote of dust in a gasping updraft  
Sunk teeth through the rind  
Nearly spat the earth from behind the soaking veil  
But hopelessly failed to tell the tale  
Fell back to jail in the nick of time  
Aligned  
The first crooked aging signs in kind  
I tell myself to slow  
But I am always left behind  
  
Temptation got us  
There is a line that never grows out  
And goes not up and over  
But brutishly flat, the little middle bits  
Brick-wall-hitting-thing of no momentum  
Things are left fractionally intact at a grave cost  
We come across nothing, so nothing gets lost  
  
We told the same jokes in a weaker way  
The other day  
Now that you belong to your day  
And I to mine  
Each presiding over itself  
The tale of infinity  
Self referential hell without you  
Stuck in the queue  
The line we longed to find the endpoint to  
That night we saw two wisps of air untangle at the flue  
Now we feel decoupled too  
  
We struck a small dent through  
Enough to curse the starting anew  
We believed in small acts of genius  
The best guess sped through a multitasked mess  
But we never quite got there  
You and I are incomplete  
I'll leave your floating endpoints be
