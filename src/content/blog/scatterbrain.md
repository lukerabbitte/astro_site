Scatterbrain scatterbrain  
Stretch your hands to the fame  
Throw your words down the drain  
You're the rules of my game  
  
Scatterbrain scatterbrain  
With your head in a book  
Your notions mistook  
You're down on your luck  
  
Scatterbrain scatterbrain  
You're worse than the police  
It's eighteen apiece  
And I'm holding my peace  
  
Scatterbrain scatterbrain  
Your train will depart  
The world is your art  
If you know where to start
