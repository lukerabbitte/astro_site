In the flash of the pan  
Trash in the garbage can  
Clanging on the roof  
Burning newsprint to warm our souls  
We pay the tolls for roads that go nowhere  
Near home  
  
Scooping us inside,  
Isteach libh  
Do you want to live in the bloody pits  
Or a bheith ag dul ar aghaidh in the midst  
Of clamour, no more hiding behind the mist  
The Foyle has split this town in two  
According to what's beginning to feel like hundreds of thousands of excuses  
Read my bleeding lips  
Everything I say spills onto newsprint  
They are having a field day  
And it tastes kind of strange  
Never the same as what they say sotto voce  
Antiquity feels a long way away until you notice  
The foreverness of today  
  
Isteach libh  
I am quizzing you  
You can lob whatever you want at me over the vanishing fence of history, sit still in your holographic, substanceless frame named the future, but still I am quizzing you  
Judging you,  
Scooping you.  
Saluting you.  
Wave back.
