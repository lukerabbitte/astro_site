What is this wide open pit I'm falling in  
What is this pithy mouthful I'm swallowing  
This isn't how I always look it's how I look right now  
This isn't how the moment passes over like a cloud  
  
Sands blow over old headstones roaming over  
Every coasting no one  
Every other bold and brazen soldier posted  
Out in cold Octobers  
This isn't how the fountain filled a pool designed to leak  
This isn't just a cheap attempt at winning your belief  
  
Soil creeps over lonely molehill shapes in open protest of the  
Silence that has gripped the room and futures of a pilot youth  
The power wasting hallway pacing headache shaking  
Sitting dying waiting longing for the making of a sacred proof  
  
You creep along honest landscapes spilling on and on into conflict  
Chipped away remains of Holy Roman roads that rose profoundly  
Linger with this pinpoint tacked  
The cold finger taps unfolding maps  
While it can be  
Mostly in motion  
  
Roads joined and curled up pointing in the spikey voice of your joint writing  
Plucked chucked and juiced and rid of all we occasion on the voiceless fruit  
And lucky to avoid the path orthogonally placed  
To the grave you stepped by and looked yourself in the face  
  
Pange lingua sing my signet soul to sleep I doze completely  
Put a wet blanket around me count me into your embankment  
Sideline your blistering wisdom as I glance sidewise through your aching eyes and  
Size up the blue skies your mind flies on and over in prize-winning demise  
  
Salvatorem exspecto, veritatem gloriosam expecto  
Inis dom faoi do chlann agus na slite ina bhfuil síad ag dul in aois  
Beannaigh sinn a athair lig do scíth beannaigh mo mháthair ina aonair  
Beannaigh mé arís ach ná tar i dtarrtháil orm go dtí go bhfiafróidh mé díot
