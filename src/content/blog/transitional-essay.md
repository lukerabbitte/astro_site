Daytime passes over;  
All is said and done  
I held out till victory was sure  
And I'm still not sure I won.  
  
Moonlight filters over  
A world I've struggled to create -  
After six long days I've parted ways;  
The seventh came too late.  
  
The conversation's over.  
No more trying to pretend.  
The air has thickened with the silence.  
My mouth is closed again.  
  
Applaud me for my scintillations,  
My times of all and times of none.  
Forgive me sealing shut my lips  
When all is said and done.
