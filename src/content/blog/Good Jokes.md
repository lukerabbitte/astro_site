What did the earnest burglar leave to the mindless times?

His rising ring finger blood
Trembling for a friend
It is the season's end
Last call of the trembling evening
The soft cream of his heart is
Curving bending
Swirling
Neverendingly
Sending print to digits
Stocky as large hurlers
Arguing a foul
The argument lithe and supple
Slides on succulent
Desperate mud
Like a speedboat cuts up
Market harbours
In disguise, he buys some of the
Tiling for his mosaic mind

Blue as a bruise
Blue as the sneezing sea
Riding a piecemeal beat
Something hackneyed stamping
Under his crosseyes
Under paper pad and pen
Squinting sore into memory
All the better to read his
Letters' cozy kerning
Always punctual
And all-knowing
Like a heavy sun
Come bouldering down
Gone to kill the kyanite day
In an orange firefight
At the crash of a gong
A sound so tunneling
You want to bury yourself under it
Remembering that your skeletons
Are nothing but a bone's throw away
A phone call made sentimentally
Low to the earth
Like a common garden spade or sparrow
It is seen as a pleasing tribute

In the middle of June he sung a tune
Baying like each cobblestone was a balloon
A scruffy ruse to jailbreak the moon
In the middle of the night's middle of the room
His withered hand curls
Prunes what hell left of his leathery fingers
And sets the hitherto still world wobbling

A throng of starlets
Seeing themselves in each and every raindrop
Handing out the incredible angles
To fishhooks falling from the sky
When underwater

Unsutured information
Blather and bluster
Proof in being the oldest
Contiguous slab of land
In the corridor
Proof of having the oldest gazing busts
Taking shape in the light of nationhood
Make sure to leave some space to
Breathe great haste into
When you lift it to the upper case
Stitch it to the upper eyelid
And remember that your skeletons
Are nothing but a bone's throw away
Or a phone call made
Sentimentally low to the earth
Like a common spade or sparrow
He is seen as a pleasing tribute

He noticed that it typically grounds down
This is the sound that dribbles out languid
Like the angelus
Swivels heads from
Sleep diagonally as he
Creeps unthanked across the lightless seabed
Or follows like a sheep
The Andes singsong
Onto the icy soundings
And the vaulting sky ahead
Nobody is helping him
The jutting peaks presume to
Peek past their oneness

He kept his friends
Like wet clothes
Hanging around a campfire
Touches away from
Cuddling in the smoke
The past burns and cracks in the present
Turnsover best creations
To the odour of giddy arson
Tense lifespan cricks the neck
Has his jaw full silhouette
Thinking in the Pyrenees star twinkle
A perfectly lined shot
Three hundred percent longer than life
The smell of longevity
Stuck in his nostrils
Eyes overnight rolled, tucked
Pirouettes inside dream soft pillows
The shape of a dream arresting itself on the shelf
He only saw his outline
Smack the daytime
Not his head
Nor an identifying finger
To lift from that great
Pool of dread
In a move of wizardlike invisibility
As a fire licks the proximity
He wrings significant disease
From his closest beings
Simply to be at his own peace
That he might chase death
Down with a questionnaire
But never catch it
Nor them theirs
Let it be task enough to stay gathering the
Moody ongoing questions and
Like animals watching trees
Move stirlessly past

Raised like wine in oak
In bloodcurdlingly firm
Airtight testaments
They told him that
A dictionary is only as good as
The words you keep learning
Twisting his fingers
Into a barrel of spirit
As though he had dropped something
He comes up for air hungry
Growthfully holding
An almond of pleasure and stops
Knowing the crooked
Spot of hunger that does not
Famished and decayed so small
So gnawingly lonely
A sapling being feasted on by a deer
That is uncaring as the stars
Passing up the chance
He creeps toward the
Vanishing point inside it
As though it were a clock tower
Or stone balloon
Grown big as a toadstool exploding

Where he has been laying prostrate
And rolling balls of doughy history
To grip onto the faint
Flour of illusion
His family is learning to
Surpass the papery grain
He relegated them to
On a blue noon
Cooling off his fingerprints
And whistling through their maze-like tune
All the callous valleys
And cracked channels
Receiving no wavelength of sympathy
Whistling shirtless, a globular form
Letting an abundant and passive freedom suckerpunch
His bare and veinlike sapling
Better unfellable boredom
Than flammable independence
He whistles and his youthful shoots and leaves
With lessening conflict tolerance
Again collapse to their roots
Green to the very knock-knees
All the way home
And surveying cool similarity - familiarity
With the most mortal
Glance this side of accident
Begging storyless meltwater
To remind itself of the glacier
Begging the hot cracked earth
Sanding his fingerprint
To keep in mind the fire in its fine-tuning
In a struggling climate
Gasping underneath
Disgusting heatstroke
All the ways a summer sun
Can oppress those outstanding in their field
Dizzy as the sentiment
Of what a lick of paint can reveal
Yet steady as the scarecrow in his back garden
Parasols of convenience shadow him
From such light showers hourly

Life is worth a fortune
It springs from every biome's contortion
Every corner is extorted
Into productivity and
Not even the rocks are safe -
The smallest stone or tallest cliff safe -
From the undercutting motion
That rocking commotion
Of becoming clipped into shape
The strength in being able to
Slip in and out of yourself

This was inevitably later set to moving picture
And like a working title
Was incredibly forgettable
The folks goading him
Told their old jokes
Thart agus thart
And threw their god-given stones at the ongoing panto
